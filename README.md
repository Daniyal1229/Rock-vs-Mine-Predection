<h1> Rock vs. Mine Prediction </h1>

<p> This project uses machine learning to predict whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine. </p>

<p> The dataset used for this project is the Sonar dataset, which can be found at  Machine Learning Repository.</p>

<p> The model is trained using the Logistic Regression algorithm. The accuracy of the model on the test dataset is 97.7%. </p>

<p>The code for this project can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Daniyal1229/rock-vs-mine-prediction">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
